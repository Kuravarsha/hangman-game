🎮 Hangman Game in Python 🐍
Welcome to the classic Hangman game built with Python! Guess the secret word before the hangman is fully drawn. 😱

📝 Overview
Hangman is a word-guessing game where the player tries to uncover a hidden word by guessing letters. If the player guesses too many wrong letters, the hangman is completed, and the game is lost.

This version of Hangman includes:

Word Categories 🐾🎬🗺️: Choose from animals, countries, or movies!
Difficulty Levels 🎯: Play at easy, medium, or hard levels!
Hint System 💡: Stuck? Ask for a hint, but use it wisely!
ASCII Art 🎨: Watch the hangman appear with every incorrect guess!
🚀 How to Run
Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/hangman-game-python.git
